"""Composer: builds the page that Playwright screenshots and the editor previews.

Reads pages from the file-backed ``PageStore``, resolves font references through
the plugin registry, emits ``@font-face`` rules for every loaded font, and
renders one ``<div class="cell">`` per cell.

For plugins that ship a ``server.py``, the composer calls ``fetch()`` and
embeds the result as ``data-data`` on the cell so client.js receives it via
``ctx.data``.

The theme system was stripped in v0.17 to clear the deck for a redesign; cells
no longer carry palette / --theme-* / --c-* tokens.
