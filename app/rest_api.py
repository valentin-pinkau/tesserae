"""REST API transport for non-MQTT clients.

The MQTT-as-default story has too much setup tax for new users (run a
broker, edit config, paste creds into every firmware). This module
adds an HTTP-polled alternative under ``/api/v1/device/*`` that maps
one-to-one to the existing MQTT contract:

* ``GET /api/v1/device/<id>/frame``     <- MQTT subscribe to retained frame topic
* ``POST /api/v1/device/<id>/status``   <- MQTT publish to status_topic
* ``POST /api/v1/device/<id>/log``      <- optional client diagnostics
* ``POST /api/v1/device/register``      <- first-boot pairing flow (no MQTT analogue;
                                           MQTT relies on the user knowing the
                                           broker creds out of band)

Auth: per-device bearer token, same primitive TRMNL devices already
use through ``/api/display``. The token is stored on the device
instance manifest as ``access_token`` and the same constant-time
compare pattern checks it.

Frame fetch uses ``If-None-Match`` for cache busting: a freshly-woken
deep-sleep client whose composition hasn't changed gets a 304 and
skips the .bin fetch + panel paint entirely (saves ~10s of Spectra 6
refresh and the matching battery hit). The MQTT retained-message
analogue would deliver the same payload again whether anything changed
or not.

The status POST's response piggybacks the latest server-side device
config AND a ``next_poll_s`` field telling the firmware when to wake
again. One round-trip per wake; the firmware doesn't need to make a
separate config poll. The ``next_poll_s`` value is the device's
configured ``sleep_interval_s`` (when one exists in the kind's
config_schema), or a reasonable per-transport default.

mypy --strict applies to this module, see pyproject.toml.

#
# The REST API was originally designed for server-to-server flows (the
# Pi clients, the ESP32 firmware) which don't care about CORS. From
# v0.63.11 the same API is callable from a browser (the in-browser
# device emulator at emulator.tesserae.ink, future "Test push" UI on
# the device card, anything else browser-based that needs to pair +
# poll). Browsers refuse cross-origin requests unless the response
# carries the ``Access-Control-Allow-*`` headers below; pre-v0.63.11
# the emulator just got a CORS error and the fetch never reached our
# code.
#
# ``Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`` is safe here because every
# endpoint already requires a Bearer token. The token is the security
# boundary, not the origin. Browser-based callers that don't have the
# token can't extract anything from a wildcard allow.
#
# Routes outside this blueprint (admin UI, settings, plugins/browse)
# aren't affected — those are same-origin from the admin page and
# don't want random origins poking at them anyway.
