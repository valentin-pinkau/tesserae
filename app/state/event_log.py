"""SQLite-backed event log.

A single ``events`` table records anything worth surfacing in the admin
timeline: push attempts (this milestone), and, in M8, renderer events,
device heartbeats, scheduler ticks. Designed for that future generalisation
from day one: the row shape is generic so M8 only adds new ``type`` values
rather than reshaping the schema.

The log is append-mostly. Deletes happen only via explicit user action
("forget this row") and from the cap-evictor (oldest beyond ``cap`` rows
get removed on insert).

mypy --strict applies to this module, see pyproject.toml.
