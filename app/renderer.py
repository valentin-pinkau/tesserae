"""Headless-browser screenshot pipeline.

Wraps Playwright's sync API. The composer route ``/compose/<id>`` is what
Chromium points at; the screenshot of that URL is the composition-orientation
PNG that every renderer plugin's ``transform()`` then takes as input.

The screenshot is always at the panel's exact pixel size, no resampling, no
DPR scaling. ``device_scale_factor=1`` is load-bearing.

Two execution paths:

* **Cold path** (``render_to_png(request)``), spins up a fresh ``sync_playwright``
  + Chromium per call. ~1–2 s overhead per render. Used when the
  ``keep_browser_warm`` toggle is off (low-memory deployments).
* **Warm path** (``render_to_png(request, pool=BrowserPool)``), reuses a
  long-lived browser owned by a dedicated worker thread, creating a fresh
  ``context`` per render so state never leaks between pushes. ~200 ms per
  render after the first warm-up. The dedicated thread is required because
  Playwright's sync API isn't thread-safe.

mypy --strict applies to this module, see pyproject.toml.

    and the launched Chromium handle. Callers from any other thread enqueue
    a (request, Future) pair and block on the future.
