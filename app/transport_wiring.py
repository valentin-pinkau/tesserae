"""MQTT transport wiring, rebuild, subscriptions, and status merging.

Lifted out of :mod:`app.main` so the factory there is just app + route
wiring. Everything here is concerned with the broker side: tearing
down and rebuilding the transport on broker setting changes, attaching
the per-device status + wildcard discovery subscriptions, and merging
incoming heartbeats into the live status cache.

External imports (tests, settings_routes diagnostics) still reference
``status_changed_meaningfully`` / ``_resolve_client_id`` etc. through
